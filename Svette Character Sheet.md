## Hunter’s Trick Blades

*Trick Weapons*

*A set of intricate weapons, bearing the insignia of a guild of hunters sworn to beat back the beast plague. Though many of them had fallen to the infection themselves, turning on their fellow man and twisting into gnarled, beastly visages, some remained. A hunter must hunt.*

Death In Six Acts: A hunter’s arsenal is, in short, myriad painful deaths. This gift switches between 3 different weapons depending on the Attribute locked into. Additionally, the specific form of the weapon varies whether it is Activated or not. The Activation state of weapons is shared across all attributes, and may be switched as a full Action or as part of an ability with the \[Transformation\] tag.

Saw Cleaver: \[Red\] \[Form\] A wicked blade, its edge serrated to tear through flesh and bone with ease. The saw, with its set of blood-letting teeth, has become a symbol of the hunt. 

* Gnashing Fang: Attacks with the Saw Cleaver ignore 2d6 DR.  
* Beastflayer: \[Inactive\] Whenever Rally is triggered with the Inactive form of this weapon, gain a stack of Boost.  
* Silent Night: \[Inactive\] \[Transformation\] \[Action\] Strike a single enemy with the dormant form. On hit, extend out the cleaver, dealing 2d6 damage in a 10ft cone. Weapon becomes Active on execution.  
* Mezzalune: \[Active\] \[Ignite\] Ignite to attack in a cone of length equal to attributes Ignited \+ 1\. Gain 1d6 additional damage for each attribute Ignited.   
* Close Shave: \[Active\] \[Exhaust\] \[Transformation\] After an attack hits, snap the blade shut, slicing through prey on its way closed. Deals d6 damage equal to the number of enemies hit by the attack. 

Bloodletter: \[Black\] \[Form\] A vicious, thorned mace, feeding on the blood of its prey. A traitorous Church assassin swore the violent expulsion of one’s lifeblood to be the only way to purge the curse, betraying his own kin. The Church provided him with a single, soundless bell of death to ensure their secrets would be kept.

* Feed the Beast: While this weapon is equipped, gain \+1d6 to Rolls to Do for each Wounded attribute.  
* Oldblood Curse: \[Dormant\] The thorns wrench blood from the same beasts they hunt. When equipped, Rally heals for 2d6 additional HP when triggered.  
* Phlebotomize: \[Dormant\] \[Transformation\] \[Action\] \[12 HP\] Plunge the mace into an enemy, making an attack with \+1d6 damage for each Locked Out or Wounded attribute of the target as the mace feeds on exposed wounds. Weapon becomes Active on execution.  
* Wolfsbane: \[Active\] \[Action\] \[8 HP\] Replaces standard Attack action. Target and any adjacent enemies take 1d6 \+ 10% max HP additional damage, separate from the original attack. Gain a stack of Bloodied Frenzy; each stack increases damage dealt and self-damage of Wolfsbane by 1d6. Bloodied Frenzy is lost upon switching off Bloodletter or switching to Dormant.  
* Left Unburied: \[Active\] \[Action\] \[Transformation\] \[10 HP\] Plunge the sanguine mass into the earth, planting its blood as a mine on an adjacent space. When a creature enters the same space as a mine, they take 4d6 damage and knockback. Weapon becomes Dormant on execution. 

Blade of Mercy: \[White\] \[Form\] An intricate shortsword, breaking apart into elegant paired daggers. Forged of sidereal, a metal plied from the stars themselves, these blades are one of the oldest creations of the workshop. 

* Skirmisher: Whenever you make an attack, you may move up to 2 spaces for free.   
* Rest For The Wicked: \[Dormant\] Damage dealt is tripled on Critical Hits. Meant for the execution of the blood-starved, the weapon takes to its solemn task with unsettling efficiency.   
* Reprisal: \[Dormant\] \[Transformation\] When you successfully dodge an attack with this weapon equipped, you may choose to switch to Active for no additional cost.  
* Warped Twinblade: \[Active\] On attack, make 2 separate rolls, each dealing half the damage. Ignite to add another roll, dealing the same damage.   
* Slicing Wind: \[Active\] \[Transformation\] \[Action\] Make 3 attacks, each dealing halved damage. Skirmisher is forcibly used to move 2 spaces directly away from struck enemy. Weapon reverts to Dormant after this ability is used. 

## Hunter’s Pistol

*Bloodtinged Firearm*

*The tools of the trade for the old hunters were as numerous as they were fickle. Modern hunters take a more pragmatic approach, though the arts they ply are largely the same.*

GUN PARRY: \[1 Quicksilver Bullet\] When targeted by an attack, before it rolls, Roll to Dye and select a new Swing for free. If this causes you to win a Clash, Stagger the enemy immediately. 

Just A Normal Gun: \[1 Quicksilver Bullet\] \[Ignite\] Deal 1d6 damage to a target within 30ft. 

Bloodtinge Chamber: This gun can only be loaded using Quicksilver Bullets or Blood Bullets. You may carry up to 20 Quicksilver Bullets at a time. Quicksilver Bullets are not replenished on death or at \[Bonfires\] must scavenge or purchase more to replenish your stock. 

Bloodstained Rounds: \[1 Blood Vial\] \[Action\] Convert one of your transfusions into piercing ammunition. Consumes a Blood Vial, adding 5 Blood Bullets to your inventory. Blood Bullets are used the same as Quicksilver Bullets, but all are lost on death. Blood Bullets do not affect the cap for Quicksilver Bullets. 

## Mark of Yharnam

*Core Mechanics*

*The insignia of the hunters’ guild carved into flesh. Though few would ever truly ascertain the plague’s cause, some suspected that Gehrman, first of the Hunters, knew all along. This sin was his to bear.*

Paleblood Hunt: Hunters held no need for armor– no amount of steel was enough to stop the beasts. Lose access to Blocking and gain no bonuses from flat Damage Reduction.

Your Dodgeroll Has I-Frames: Gain an additional \+2d6 bonus to Dodge.

Rally: Landing a successful attack on an enemy that damaged you this Act recovers half of the HP taken by the enemy’s attack. 

Dance Of Death: Enemies in the same scene as you gain a Guard Break gauge, ranging from 0 to the sum of their attribute count and levels. Whenever you attack an enemy, the damage dealt is also partially converted into stagger, with diminishing returns as damage rises. 

When the Guard Break gauge is full, it is reset to zero and the target is inflicted with Stagger for the next 3 turns. Staggered enemies are stunned, and automatically fail against attacks rolled against them, but the first attack against them will remove Staggered. 

Visceral: You always deal a critical hit against Staggered enemies. 

Blood Vials: Emergency transfusions carried by all hunters, meant to purge the old blood. Carry up to 5 Blood Vials at a time, using them as an Action to recover 60% of maximum HP. Blood Vials are not replenished on death or at \[Bonfires\], and must be purchased or scavenged.

## “That’s How They Made Us, Isn’t It?”

*Bond \- The Doll*  
**Level 1**  
Echoes of Violence: Slain enemies drop Blood Echoes, which can be spent to… *Could* be spent to level up with The Doll’s help.  
Whenever you die, leave a pool of Blood Echoes behind. You can collect these in your next life, though should you die before doing so, they are lost.  
**Level 2**  
A Tool Forged in Blood: Whenever you are wounded, your body retaliates almost automatically, built as it is to kill. Attack the target that wounded you if possible, rolling Wild with a bonus to the roll equal to the damage that dealt the wound.  
**Level 3**  
**Level 4**  
Dear Hunter, My Love, My Mirror: You truly are her Mirror. You gain the ability to spend Blood Echoes to empower others, as she empowered you. But those without Tainted Blood will find these boons fleeting. Any buffs given out by this ability are lost upon death or the use of a Bonfire.
