# Red Ranger: Meshi

## You’re a Goddamn Power Ranger

*Class, Core Mechanics*

*There’s no other way to put it. You’re a goddamn power ranger. Here’s how that works.*

It’s Morphin’ Time\!: \[Action\] Call upon your Cell Beetle and initiate a lengthy transformation sequence, donning your crimson armor that burns with the flame of your soul\! When you transform this way, create an explosion behind you that hits anything in a 10 foot cone for 3d6 damage.

If you use this ability on the first Turn of the First Act of a combat, you may take an additional Turn later in the Act.

Crimson Flame of Justice, Blaze Kabuto\!: Your heroic visage, like the exoskeleton of a great beetle\! While transformed, Double your HP and the bonuses of all of your Attributes.

Heroic Soul, Externalized: Your flaming soul has become armor, and allows you to fight for Justice\! Improve the effects of any \[Ignite\] or \[Exhaust\] ability by 1d6 (dodging and blocking become 2d6, ect).

Automatic Deactivation Protocol: Your armor has a failsafe that will depower you before your death. The first time you are wounded in a Conflict, you can choose to drop your transformation and heal yourself to Full HP. If you Don’t, The next time you are wounded, you automatically drop the transformation and set yourself to one HP.

Secret Power Unleashed\! Deus Ex Machina Overdrive: \[1/Session\] \[Action\] A true hero is prepared for every possible eventuality. Reveal a weapon or ability you’ve had prepared all along for just this occassion, describing in loose terms its function and form. The revealed power becomes a Gift added to your character sheet. Revealed Power Gifts are lost on death, but may be retrieved from your \[Bloodstain\] to immediately re-equip them. Take note, however, that these gifts are both fairly small and highly simplistic, and this ability requires an open gift slot to use. 

My Lie: Under no circumstances can this ability be shared with other players before it is revealed. {INSERT TRIGGER CONDITIONS}, the power within your suit consumes your being, causing you to go Berserk. While Berserk, you lose control of the suit entirely, with all motives superceded by one central drive: Kill the target you last attacked. When this target dies, your target switches to a new creature on the current map. You gain an additional Black \+9 Attribute, and all your attributes always clash (yes, even then.) This continues until there are no targets on the current map or until it can be deactivated by forcing your armor to retract. 

## Our Powers Combined

*Trope*

The Power of Friendship: Your true strength, the bonds of courage that light the fire of your soul\! Whenever you give or are given Support, add 2d6 \+ 4 instead of 1d6.

I’m gonna make One Trillion Friends\!: A promise made to a future that will never come, but that won’t stop you from trying. This gift can store infinite Bond Gifts within, allowing you to equip any and all of them simultaneously

Blast Into the Future, Chou JuunenHou\!: \[Combo Tech\]\[1/Session\] With the help of your allies, blast through any obstacle by combining the weapons of those you left behind\!

When you activate a Combination Attack, you may summon the Chou JuunenHou (super decade cannon), manning it with yourself and anyone who joins in on the attack. Everyone but you who joins forfeits their action, but adds their Swing to the Attack, and may use the free Ignite to push the Accuracy or Damage, or to Add Targets or Knockback, their choice (they must choose before rolling).
