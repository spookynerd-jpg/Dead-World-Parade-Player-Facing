# Seagazer

## Seagazer, Reforged Future

*Reflection, Weapon, Self*  
*Your true self, the Blade crafted by a story, half-told. A weapon yet to be born.*  
*Yet here you are.*  
*Created to slay God and Tormented alike, none of those stand before you now.*  
*So do what you do best, and go find some new Gods to Slay.*  
**Level 1:**  
Shackle Breaker: At the beginning of your turn, you may Roll to Dye. If you do so, you must Lock In the highest result. Then you may use any of the following abilities. If you use the corresponding color, add 1d6 to the Roll to Do.

* Red: Ark Inferno: Stabs the blade into the ground and fires a jet of astral sea like a thruster. Move up to your Speed as part of this attack. Create an Astral Sea tile in the square you leave in the square you begin and end in. If this attack is initiated or completed in a space of Astral Sea, consume it to add 1d6 to the attack and damage. Gain a \+1 on the roll for every space of Astral Sea moved through as part of this attack   
* Blue: Bandit Heroics: There’s no Flame to steal, but you need some way to clean up after yourself, huh? Strike a target and rip the infection from them, removing burn up to the damage dealt and dealing damage equal to the burn removed. You gain Damage Resistance against the next attack that hits you equal to the burn removed this way.  
* Yellow: Nine Guns Ignition: Detonate a burst of Astral Sea. Attack an adjacent creature and all creatures adjacent to them. On a success knock them into the air 1d6 spaces and create a Tile of Astral Sea beneath them. They fall at the start of your next turn. If any ally attacks them in the air and forces them to fall, they take an additional 1d6 damage for every space fallen. If this attack is initiated in a space of Astral Sea, consume it and add 1d6 to the knock up.

On completion of one of the above abilities, you may drop your Swing and Roll to Dye once more. Regain HP equal to the dice you lock in. You may lock out the dice you do not lock in to increase the HP recovered by an amount equal to the result of that die.

Oceans and Ash: Whenever an adjacent creature targets an ally, you may Ignite to modify any roll that that creature makes as if it were targeting you. Doing so creates a Tile of Astral Sea below yourself.

**Level 2:**  
Cancel Burst: Respond to an attack by blowing your attacker and all creatures adjacent to you back 9 spaces. Damage from the triggering attack cannot exceed 9\. Your attacker’s turn (if they are taking one) ends. Then, take a turn immediately. Usable any time, even while not under attack. Once per Conflict. 

Foreteller, Clouded: \[Set Action\\Support\] *Your vision struggles to pierce the fog… but, like, when has shit like that ever stopped you, ya know? Run those goddamn numbers like you always do.*

Roll to dye to attempt to pierce the fog and run those goddamn numbers. For each of your attributes that rolls a 4 or above, you select a single part of the current Scene; a character, a piece of terrain, a specific attack, ect. You learn what will occur in the immediate future for every part of the scene you chose, though the rest remains clouded.

You then may use that information in any way you wish; it will occur exactly as you have predicted, unless you act to change it. You may choose to Set an Action related to any part of your vision, or Support by giving that information to an ally.

**Level 3:**  
Astral Rupture: \[Action\\ignite\] As Ace Act II.

Biggest Bang: \[Action\\Ignite\] As Ace Act II. However, detonates all spaces of astral sea connected to your square and the target’s square, potentially creating a chain reaction and repeating the attack on all those adjacent to a square of Astral Sea. You cannot be hit by two instances of this ability at once. If your target, however, is knocked back the full number of spaces and would be hit by a second instance of Biggest Bang, you may hit them with Big Bang once more, knocking them back *again*. 

Outer World Eclipse: Consume a square of Astral Sea to begin Burning. This will remain until you or an ally spends an Action putting the fire out. Burning stacks up to 9 times. While Burning all your Actions deal 1d6 extra damage and Burn for every level of Burning, and 1d6 damage to you. Damage dealt in this way cannot be healed by any means other than Rest.

## Threat to Reality

*Curse, Blight*

*You are a Flametouched, in a world devoid of flame. Normally your every surrounding would be an active infohazard. Thankfully, you are Seagazer, so you should be fine.*

*You are a Flametouched, in a world devoid of flame. Normally, atleast with the help of whatever brought you here, your cage would keep you from being an active Biohazard. Sadly, you are Seagazer, so you are absolutely NOT fine.*

Spontaneous Human Combustion: Nothing around you is Flametouched. Yet.

Whenever a being other than yourself gains Burn, they begin to Degrade. For every 10 burn they get, roll on The Burn Table ™. If a creature reaches 100 burn, they combust, reduced to nothing but sludge. This is unrecoverable.

Any burn on characters who have not reached 100 is reset any time you rest at a Bonfire.

Astral Corrosion: Many of your abilities create Astral Sea. This was already an environmental hazard; now its closer to nuclear fallout.

Any being other than yourself who begins or ends a turn Adjacent to a tile of Astral Sea takes 1d6 burn, doubled if they are physically within the astral sea.

At the start of every Act, if there are any tiles of Astral Sea on the battlefield, randomly Extend all sections of Astral Sea by 1 square. If two disconnected sections meet this way, turn every tile adjacent to their meeting spot into Astral Sea.

If a Tile on the Travel Map becomes Engulfed in Astral Sea, it is Lost. Mayhaps *you* could find it again, but nobody else can.

Whenever you rest at a Bonfire, clean up any tiles of Astral Sea that have not Engulfed a Travel Map Tile.

Cosmic Blooded: Whenever an attack deals damage to you, you may Ignite to create a number of squares of Astral Sea equal to the damage taken.

**Level Up: Fully Degrade Someone or Fully Clear a Map Without Leaving Flame Behind.**

## Mic Bond \[ONCE BURNED, RECOVERED\]

*???*  
*You still haven’t quantified what this means, but you don’t **need** to to know that something precious has been lost.*

*Find Her.*
