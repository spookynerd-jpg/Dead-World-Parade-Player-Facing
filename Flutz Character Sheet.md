## 1,001 Tricks

*Magic Hat Inventory*

*A magician is always prepared\! Your hat’s full of gadgets and gizmos, and with a flip of the cape and a trick of the light, you can make them do just about anything\!*

Bottomless Bag: This gift functions as an inventory of sorts. By creating or finding gadgets, you may add them to 1,001 Tricks as abilities. Additionally, \[Souls\] may be stashed in the hat to be retained on death. 

Concussive Charge: \[Action\] Place a bomb on an adjacent space, declaring a number of turns until it detonates. When it detonates, all creatures within 10 feet must succeed a Roll to Dye or take 12 Knockback (halved on success).

Adventurer’s Best Friend: \[Move\] Pull yourself to a wall or object within Line of Sight and 60ft. This ability may also be used on other creatures, pulling you to ones larger than yourself and pulling ones as small or smaller than you to your position. This is classified as forced movement. 

Trusty Boomerang: \[Action\] Throw a boomerang at a target within 80 ft, making a Contested roll against them at \+1d6 difficulty. On a hit, the target has one of their attributes Exhausted until the end of their next turn. If target is outside of Line of Sight, roll is made at \+2d6 difficulty. After execution, catching the boomerang pushes you back 5 ft.

## Outdated Physics Engine

*Core Mechanics*

Ice Physics: Whenever you move, you must either move 5 feet in a short hop, or move in a straight line until you collide with an object.

Broken Ice Physics: *That's not supposed to do that…* Whenever an effect causes you to move outside of your normal movement or a sprint, move an additional 15 feet in a straight line. Yes, even straight up. Yes, even in the air.

Miscalibrated Momentum: your momentum physics are so jank. Whenever you are affected by forced movement and stopped before using it all (by a wall, character, ect), your momentum is preserved until you take a Move action or Sprint. As soon as your path is no longer obstructed, you instantly use all remaining stored movement.

Whenever you start your turn with any Preserved Momentum, increase that Preserved Momentum by 15\.

while you have any Preserved Momentum, you have a fall speed of 0\.

Rated E for Everyone: Flutz is, sadly, contractually prevented from committing anything beyond the level of cartoon violence. Lose the ability to make standard Attack actions. 

Goomba Stomp: Flutz’ contractual restrictions will not stop it from trying. When you land vertically on another creature, make a contested Roll against them. Regardless of result, move 5 feet afterwards as you spring off their head. 

## Speedrunner’s Soul

*Bond \- GDQ*  
*Your game never reached its target audience, was basically uncompletable by the children you wanted to dazzle. But a group of dedicated fans found the way to see the end of your tale…*  
*And then they started doing it Faster.*  
**Level 1:**  
Tech Discovery: \[Exploration Activity\] The start of any good speedrun is finding the tech.  
Choose a single ability from your kit, a character, or a tile on the map to Research. Roll to Do; every 5 is 1 success. At 10 total successes researching a single item, gain a new bit of Tech with it, unlocking a new effect or combo.  
**~~Level up: Get your record broken on stage~~**  
**Level 2:**  
Early Resets don’t hurt: \[1\\Scene\] Resetting early for a good run is a classic strat. At the end of your first turn of a Scene, if you do not like how the turn panned out, you may reset everything to how it was at the start of your turn and try again.
